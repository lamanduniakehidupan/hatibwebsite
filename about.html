        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>
         Hi!! My name is Ahmad Hatib bin Hamzah a.k.a hatib or tib . I was born and raised at Bandar Baru Bangi and believe me or not im the <a href="images/siblings.jpg" style="color:red;">youngest</a> among my 5 siblings. I have a good relationships with my siblings and the closest one is my  <a href="images/bros.jpeg" style="color:blue">brother </a> who always help me and teach me everything from riding a bicycle to a motorcyle to a car and now i even have my own license thanks to him. I am now finishing my Diploma in Information Management this year and it was a good journey. I get to know a lots of different friends from different places and background yet we shared a memorable memories. My <a href="images/class.jpeg" style="color:green;"> classmates </a> also teach me how to survive in the real world and how to be strong . I hope that we can cross path and meet with  each one of us being 
         successful .
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
         Before entering diploma in UiTM , to be honest my hope was crushed bcs of my first upu got rejected and i was a bit down of it but my sisters wont giveup on pushing me to try apply again and again , lastly i got accepted into the second intake of UiTM Machang. Starting from there i realize that you dont have to giveup so early just because one dream of yours is crushed , there is always another chance in this life we just need to word hard on it. Now , im going to always work hard to pursue what i dream .

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
         I am a workaholic person that means i enjoy working when semester break.My first work after the spm is working at the 99SPEEDMART as a storekeeper. Working there as a fresh spm graduates taught me how adults life are , how tiring it is to earn money. I work there for like 8 months while waiting to continue my studies. During semester break on semester 2 i work at Bulan Bintang HQ.What made the experience truly special was the <a href="video/rayabulbin.mp4" style="color:red;">people</a>. It was one of the most valuable experiences in my journey so far. During my time there, I didn’t just learn how to manage stock or handle daily tasks  I also learned about teamwork, commitment, and the real meaning of workplace responsibility.
         
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 

          
          The friends I made there weren’t just colleagues  they became like family. They taught me a lot not just about work, but about life as well. We built a strong bond, shared laughter, faced challenges together, and created memories that I’ll always carry with me.

          Looking back, working at Bulan Bintang gave me the confidence and mindset to keep improving myself, and I’ll always be grateful for that chapter in my life.
